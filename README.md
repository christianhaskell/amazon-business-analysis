# Amazon Business Data Analysis

This project analyzes over 1,400 Amazon product listings to uncover patterns in customer engagement, pricing strategy, and product ratings. Using Python, pandas, and visualization tools, I explored how discounts, reviews, and ratings influence customer behavior. This project was created as part of my data analytics portfolio to demonstrate real-world data cleaning, EDA, and insight generation.

## Key Insights
- **Discounts between 10–20%** showed a notable increase in review volume and rating consistency.
- **Highly rated products (4–4.5 stars)** had the strongest review engagement.
- **Positive review word clouds** revealed common value indicators like "quality," "fast shipping," and "easy to use."

## Next Steps
- Build an interactive dashboard using Tableau or Streamlit
- Apply sentiment analysis on review text
- Connect product attributes to review trends with regression modeling
